## What It Does
TrustChain upgrades Fairtrade from user reputation → **sybil-proof LP delegation.

Fairtrade scores individual traders. TrustChain verifies LP pools aren't 1 person gaming 100 fake wallets stealing Raydium's $10B TVL rewards.

**How it works:**
- Gini coefficient flags unnatural wallet distributions (0.92 sybil detection)
- Behavioral scoring across volume/time patterns
- On-chain oracle any DEX calls (Raydium/Jupiter ready)

**Result:** Fairtrade user rep + TrustChain LP verification = complete trust layer for Solana DeFi.
## Current Features
- WalletConnect integration (Keplr, Leap)
- Dynamic reputation scoring (hash-based, 100–1000)
- Daily claim transactions (+25 reputation)
- Glassmorphism UI (mobile responsive)

**Demo Flow**: Connect wallet → See score → Claim reputation → Success popup with testnet explorer link
