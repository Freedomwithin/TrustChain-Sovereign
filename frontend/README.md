# TrustChain - Osmosis Reputation System

**Live Demo**: https://trust-chain-frontend-ci2q.vercel.app/

## What It Does
TrustChain transforms Osmosis from a DEX into a trust network. Users connect wallets, earn reputation through daily claims, and build verifiable trust scores that power DeFi interactions. No more anonymous trading - reputation becomes your on-chain identity.

## Current Features
- WalletConnect integration (works with Keplr, Leap)
- Dynamic reputation scoring (hash-based, 100-1000 range)  
- Claim transactions (+25 daily reputation)
- Glassmorphism UI, mobile responsive
- Live on Vercel with auto-deploy

**Demo Flow**: Connect wallet → See score → Claim reputation → Success popup with testnet explorer link

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS
Wallet: WalletConnect v2 + wagmi/core 3.2.2
Deployment: Vercel (GitHub auto-deploy)
Chain: Osmosis mainnet/testnet ready


## Setup (trustchain-vite folder)
```bash
cd trustchain-vite
npm install
npm run dev
```
