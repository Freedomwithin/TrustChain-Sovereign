# TrustChain

**Decentralized Identity and Reputation System for DeFi**

## Overview

TrustChain is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Osmosis blockchain that aims to establish a trustless and transparent reputation system for DeFi users. It leverages decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and on-chain activity to generate verifiable reputation scores, enabling users to build trust and access new opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Features

* **Decentralized Identities (DIDs):** Create and manage unique digital identities linked to user wallets.
* **Reputation Scores:** Generate dynamic reputation scores based on on-chain activity, governance participation, and other factors.
* **Governance Voting:** Participate in Osmosis governance proposals using your DID and reputation.
* **Transaction History:** View and verify your on-chain transaction history.
* **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Designed to be compatible with other Cosmos-based blockchains via IBC.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Blockchain Interaction:** CosmJS
* **Wallet Connection:** Reown
* **Smart Contracts:** CosmWasm (future implementation)
